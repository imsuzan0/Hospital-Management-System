# 🏥 Hospital Management System in Java

This is a simple **Hospital Management System** built using Java. It uses **`.txt` files** to store data for doctors, patients, and appointments — making it a great beginner-friendly project to understand file handling, object-oriented programming, and menu-driven programs.

## 📁 Project Structure

The system includes three main data files:
- `doctors.txt` – Stores doctor information (Name, Specialization, Number of Patients)
- `patients.txt` – Stores patient information (Name, Age, Gender, Address, Phone)
- `appointments.txt` – Stores appointment details (Doctor Name, Patient Name, Date)

## ⚙️ Features

- Add new **Doctor**
- Add new **Patient**
- **View** all doctors and patients
- Check if a **patient exists**
